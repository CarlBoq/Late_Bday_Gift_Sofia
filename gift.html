        I just want to say that late happy birthday! I am truly grateful that nakilala kita. I don’t regret anything—all the moments we shared, the laughter, the stories, and the time we spent together in the past days.

    Every second with you has been special, and I cherish those memories deeply. You’ve brought joy, comfort, and warmth into my life, and for that, I am endlessly thankful.

    I may be late in saying this, but my wishes for you remain the same: happiness, success, and love in everything you do. You deserve all the beautiful things in life, and I hope this year brings you even more reasons to smile.

    Stay amazing, and always remember that you are appreciated more than words can express.
